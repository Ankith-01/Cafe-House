    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Cafe House is not like anything you will have seen before and many people ask what we are. You need to experience us, really, as no label does us justice… Picture a home with its doors thrown open to anyone who comes. A welcoming space, full of good
        food, with coffee always on and brimming with love. What might you call such a place? “Relationships cafe” is mayhap the closest one. We have also been described as a social space, a fusion of a coffee house, a kitchen and an events venue, with
        relationships and people at its heart. What might you do in such a place? What one would do in a home and its kitchen: cook, eat, drink, converse, socialise. Hold parties sometimes. Hold talks, learn, brainstorm, enjoy, mourn, celebrate… Live
        one’s life. </p>
